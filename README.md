# IVAR_model_w_selected_moderators
IVAR model (interacted vector autoregression) with selected moderators applied with oil price shocks and GDP growth <br>
The repository does not included dataset, just the code to run the regression and IVAR functions. <br>
The IVAR algorithms is based on the interacted panel VAR by Towbin and Weber (2013) but allows to apply the moderator effect on selected variables only.

Code is based on Stata and Matlab, IRFs are created with R.
